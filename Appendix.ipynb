    "> Note: In some litreature, simulation and data science have been looked up on as two opposite ends on a spectrum. However, it is more comfortable for me to view data science as a special case of simulation science, where you establish the simulation parameters from data. I would rather make a spectrum of models that rely on domain knowledge on one end and event data on the other end. But this is just one of the perspectives of definitions."
